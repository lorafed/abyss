## Installation

### Requirements

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher**
- **Minecraft 1.8+** (compatible with most versions)
- **A launcher that supports modded clients (Badlion, Lunar, etc.)**

### Steps

1. **Download Abyss Client:**  
   Get the latest release, which includes the DLL file (e.g., `AbyssClient.dll`) and an injector tool.

2. **Backup Your Minecraft Folder:**  
   Always back up your current Minecraft installation to prevent data loss.

3. **Prepare Your Launcher:**
   - **For Badlion/Lunar Users:**  
     Follow your launcher’s instructions to load external mods. Abyss Client will be injected into the running Minecraft process rather than loaded as a traditional `.jar`.

## DLL Injection Usage Guide

**Important:**  
- **Risk Warning:** DLL injection can trigger anti-cheat systems and may result in bans.  
- **Backup:** Always back up your Minecraft installation before proceeding.  
- **Legal Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational and testing purposes only. The developers are not liable for any consequences of its use.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download and Verify Files**
   - Download the Abyss Client package containing `AbyssClient.dll` and the accompanying injector tool.
   - Verify the files’ integrity (e.g., using provided checksums) to ensure they haven’t been tampered with.

2. **Launch Minecraft**
   - Start Minecraft through your preferred launcher (Badlion, Lunar, etc.).
   - Log in and wait until the game has fully loaded to the main menu or join a server.

3. **Identify the Minecraft Process**
   - **Using Process Hacker or System Informer:**  
     Open Process Hacker or System Informer to view running processes. Look for the `javaw.exe` process, which is the Minecraft process.
   - **Using the Injector Tool’s Process List:**  
     Alternatively, if your injector tool displays a process list, locate `javaw.exe` there.

4. **Run the Injector Tool**
   - Launch the provided injector application (running it as administrator may be necessary).
   - Select the `javaw.exe` process from the list (using Process Hacker/System Informer or the injector’s built-in list).
   - Click the **Inject** button or follow the on-screen prompts.
   - A confirmation message should indicate successful injection.

5. **Access the Client Features**
   - Return to Minecraft. You should now see the Abyss Client overlay or settings menu (default keybind might be `Right Shift` or another configurable key).
   - Use the menu to toggle features like ESP, autoclicker, and more.

6. **Exiting the Client**
   - To unload the DLL, either close Minecraft or use the injector’s **Unload** feature if available.
   - For added safety, consider restarting your system to clear any residual injection.

  Scroll through the list of modules. Each module (such as ESP, KillAura, or Fly) offers toggles and detailed sub-settings.

- **Module Configuration:**  
  - **ESP:** Adjust visual parameters like color, opacity, and distance.  
  - **Autoclicker:** Set CPS range, enable randomness, and assign toggle keys.  
  - **Combat Modules:** Fine-tune targeting radius, attack intervals, and activation settings.

  Settings are saved automatically, but you can export/import configuration profiles for different servers or scenarios.
